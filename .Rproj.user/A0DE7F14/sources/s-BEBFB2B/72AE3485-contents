Two datasets were used in this **portfolio**

1 | The big list  
This dataset is derived from [Kaggle - Ramen Ratings](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/residentmario/ramen-ratings?resource=download). [**THE RAMEN RATER**](https://www.theramenrater.com/) has full credit to this dataset.  
2 | Review list from [**Happy Souper**](https://www.happysouper.de/)

# Limitations of database
- **Source of Data**
  - Data are **not official** and many terms are not defined.
  - The dataset relies on **personal preference**, it may not be subjective enough, but still can be referenced and compared with the popularities defined by marketsales.
  - Not all the ramens on market is included, thus may be not comprehensive enough.
  - The **different tastes** _(Sweet, sour, spicy etc.)_ can be categorized to give a better reference to readers.  

- **DV**
  - Due to the limitation with data and R programming skills, the DV types and styles is limited.
  - More **interactive** DV can be made.
  - More **detailed information** can be added to avoid creating overlapping DV.

<br/>

# Future insights
- We may reference to the DV to predict the place that has a good over-all ramen quality
- By mapping with the marketsales, we can indentify the companies that would have a greater influence on the ramens globally
