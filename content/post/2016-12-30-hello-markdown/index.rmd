Singapore clearly wins the game, but what about the performance of the ramens from other countries? We have picked out all ramens that **ranking from 4-5**, to see where do our top-rated ramens from:

```{R, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide', fig.keep='all', warning=FALSE} 
library(readxl)
toprating_country<- read_excel("toprating-country.xlsx")
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(toprating_country, aes(x = reorder(Country, +Ramen), y= Ramen,fill=Ramen))+
     geom_bar(stat="identity", width = 0.5)+
     geom_text(aes(label=Ramen), vjust=0) +
     scale_fill_gradient(low = "yellow", high = "red")+
     labs(x="Country",
          y="Numbers of Ramen", 
          title="Where do ramens ranked>4 from")+ 
     theme_bw()+
     theme(plot.title = element_text(size=22),axis.text.x= element_text(size=12,angle=60),
           axis.text.y= element_text(size=15), axis.title=element_text(size=18)
           )

```

From this bargraph, we did see that you are very hard to get an unsatisfied ramen! Wihle we also see that Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Mainland China are in the list, these countries/regions shared a long history of comsuming Ramen, which proved that practice makes the best.

More importantly, let's inspect the performance of different brands.  
Below shows the distribution of our top-rated ramen between different brands, point to different areas to see the number of top-rated ramen they have!

```{r, out.width="100%",include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide', fig.keep='all', warning=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("myFile.html", height="540px")
```
This chart only annotated the brands that has more than 10 ramens on the list. Nissin is outstanding among the brands. Which may due to its long  history starts from 1950's and the fantastic tastes.
