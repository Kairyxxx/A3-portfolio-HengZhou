Singapore clearly wins the game, but what about the performance of the ramen from other countries? We have picked out all ramens that **ranking from 4-5**, to see where our top-rated ramens come from:

```{R, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide', fig.keep='all', warning=FALSE} 
library(readxl)
toprating_country<- read_excel("toprating-country.xlsx")
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(toprating_country, aes(x = reorder(Country, +Ramen), y= Ramen,fill=Ramen))+
     geom_bar(stat="identity", width = 0.5)+
     geom_text(aes(label=Ramen), vjust=0) +
     scale_fill_gradient(low = "yellow", high = "red")+
     labs(x="Country",
          y="Numbers of Ramen", 
          title="Where do ramens ranked>4 from")+ 
     theme_bw()+
     theme(plot.title = element_text(size=22),axis.text.x= element_text(size=12,angle=60),
           axis.text.y= element_text(size=15), axis.title=element_text(size=18)
           )

```

From this bar-graph, we did see that you are very hard to get an unsatisfied ramen! While we also see that Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and Mainland China are on the list, these countries/regions shared a long history of consuming Ramen, which proved that practice makes the best.

More importantly, let's inspect the performance of different brands.  
Below shows the distribution of our top-rated ramen between different brands, point to different areas to see the number of top-rated ramens they have!

```{r, out.width="100%",include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide', fig.keep='all', warning=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("myFile.html", height="540px")
```
This chart only annotated the brands that have more than 10 ramen on the list. Nissin is outstanding among the brands. This may be due to its long history starting from the 1950s and its fantastic tastes.
