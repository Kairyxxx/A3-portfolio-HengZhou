<p>Two datasets were used in this <strong>portfolio</strong></p>
<p>1 | The big list<br />
This dataset is derived from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/residentmario/ramen-ratings?resource=download">Kaggle - Ramen Ratings</a>. <a href="https://www.theramenrater.com/"><strong>THE RAMEN RATER</strong></a> has full credit to this dataset.<br />
2 | Review list from <a href="https://www.happysouper.de/"><strong>Happy Souper</strong></a></p>

<div id="limitations-of-database" class="section level1">
<h1>Limitations of database</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Source of Data</strong>
<ul>
<li>Data are <strong>not official</strong> and many terms are not defined.</li>
<li>The dataset relies on <strong>personal preference</strong>, it may not be subjective enough, but still can be referenced and compared with the popularities defined by market sales.</li>
<li>Not all the ramen on market is included, thus maybe not be comprehensive enough.</li>
<li>The <strong>different tastes</strong> <em>(Sweet, sour, spicy, etc.)</em> can be categorized to give a better reference to readers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>DV</strong>
<ul>
<li>Due to the limitation of data and R programming skills, the DV types and styles are limited.</li>
<li>More <strong>interactive</strong> DV can be made.</li>
<li>More <strong>detailed information</strong> can be added to avoid creating overlapping DV.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>

<div id="future-insights" class="section level1">
<h1>Future insights</h1>
<ul>
<li>We may reference the DV to predict the place that has a good overall ramen quality</li>
<li>By mapping with the market sale, we can identify the companies that would have a greater influence on the ramens globally</li>
</ul>
