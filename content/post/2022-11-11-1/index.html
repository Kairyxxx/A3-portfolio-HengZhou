<div id="limitations-of-database" class="section level1">
<h1>Limitations of database</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Source of Data</strong>
<ul>
<li>Data are <strong>not official</strong> and many terms are not defined.</li>
<li>The dataset relies on <strong>personal preference</strong>, it may not be subjective enough, but still can be referenced and compared with the popularities defined by marketsales.</li>
<li>Not all the ramens on market is included, thus may be not comprehensive enough.</li>
<li>The <strong>different tastes</strong> <em>(Sweet, sour, spicy etc.)</em> can be categorized to give a better reference to readers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>DV</strong>
<ul>
<li>Due to the limitation with data and R programming skills, the DV types and styles is limited.</li>
<li>More <strong>interactive</strong> DV can be made.</li>
<li>More <strong>detailed information</strong> can be added to avoid creating overlapping DV.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>

<div id="future-insights" class="section level1">
<h1>Future insights</h1>
<ul>
<li>We may reference to the DV to predict the place that has a good over-all ramen quality</li>
<li>By mapping with the marketsales, we can indentify the companies that would have a greater influence on the ramens globally</li>
</ul>
